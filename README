resolve is a simple program to resolve a given hostname to a numeric
IP address.

Rationale:
I have more than once required DNS resolution of a domain name. Existing
tools such as dig, host, and nslookup give more information than
necessary. The existing tools also bypass the libc resolver and communicate
directly with DNS servers, missing /etc/hosts.

Building:
    A C compiler with libc and the make utility are required to build.

    make
    make install

Usage: resolve [-4|-6] HOSTNAME
Resolve a hostname to numeric IP addresses

  -4 Use IPv4
  -6 Use IPv6
